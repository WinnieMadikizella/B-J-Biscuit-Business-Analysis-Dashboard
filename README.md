Revenue Analysis: Displayed both absolute revenue (e.g., $ values) and percentage contribution:
- Quarterly Revenue Change (Q1 and Q2 contributed ~70% of annual revenue)
- Monthly Revenue Change: Peak months (Jan, Mar, Jul) generated 37.4%
- Weekly Revenue Contribution: Slightly higher on weekdays (72.6%) than weekends (27.4%)

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Double Down on Premium Products**  
   With nearly 90% of revenue coming from the expensive product category, thereâ€™s strong justification to expand or promote premium biscuit offerings.

2. **Target Key Customer Segments**  
   Focus marketing and promotional efforts on male customers and the 30â€“44 & 60â€“74 age groups, who are driving the majority of revenue.

3. **Leverage Top Performers and High-Value Accounts**  
   Replicate successful strategies from top performers like Travis Doyle and high-value customers such as Robert Hernandez to boost overall sales effectiveness.

4. **Invest in San Antonio and Similar Markets**  
   Given San Antonioâ€™s leading $7.3M revenue contribution, itâ€™s a prime candidate for localized campaigns. Consider expanding into similar high-performing urban markets.

5. **Capitalize on Seasonal Trends**  
   Maximize revenue during peak months (January, March, July) through advanced campaign planning, inventory readiness, and seasonal product bundles.

6. **Boost Weekend Sales Performance**  
   Since only 27.4% of revenue comes from weekends, introducing weekend-only offers or family-themed promotions could help balance performance across the week.
